"Recently, seasonal dead zones in low-oxygen waters have been occurring annually in the Gulf of Mexico near the mouth of the Mississippi River.

Which of the following factors most likely triggers the algal blooms and the associated dead zones?",A decrease in the light level in surface waters as day length starts to shorten after the summer solstice,Increased predation by marine larvae and other zooplankton during the summer months,A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus,Decreased competition from other marine phytoplankton during the summer months,C
