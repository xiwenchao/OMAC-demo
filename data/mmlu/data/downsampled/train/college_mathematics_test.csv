"Water drips out of a hole at the vertex of an upside down cone at a rate of 3 cm^3 per minute. The
cone’s height and radius are 2 cm and 1 cm, respectively. At what rate does the height of the water change
when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone? The volume of a cone is V = (π/3)*r^2*h,
where r is the radius and h is the height of the cone.",−48/π cm/min,−4/(3π) cm/min,−8/(3π) cm/min,−16/(3π) cm/min,D
